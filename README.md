## Explanation

The Account contract inherits from the Ownable contract, which provides a modifier for restricting access to certain functions only to the contract owner. It also implements the ERC165 interface for supporting the identification of contract interfaces. It provides various functionalities for interacting with ERC20 tokens and ERC721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It allows the owner of the contract to perform specific actions such as making calls to external contracts, sending ERC20 tokens, and transferring ERC721 tokens.
